FINAL YEAR PROJECT
SUPPORTING MATERIAL
-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------

The supporting material is divided in two parts:
1. Machine Learning
2. Web Application

Machine Learning
----------------
This repositiory contains:
Image Collection, Labelling and Data Augmentation.ipynb
Installing TensorFlow.ipynb
Training.ipynb
TensorFlow(Folder)


All the dependencies required to run the scripts are included
and will be automatically installed. The order in which the 
scripts are listed is the order of execution. Note that to run
training.ipynb a dataset is required. The dataset used for the
project was created from scratch but can not be submitted as its
too large. Hence in order to run Training.ipynb a dataset will
need to created by using the Image Collection, Lablling and Data
Augmentation.ipynb script. Additionally, CUDA and CUDNN may need
to be installed for TensorFlow GPU support. The scripts are ipynb
and can be opened on Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

The TensorFlow repository contains a frozen graph of the final model and
its tensorflowjs version. Additionally, the metrics for training and
evaluation are also present, these can be open with TensorBoard, TensorBoard
is a part of TensorFlow and will be installed by the script 'Installing
TensorFlow.ipynb'

Web Application
----------------
This repository contains the HTML and JavaScript files used to
create the web application. The web application has been
deployed online and can be accessed at: 

https://ibrahim-roy.github.io/Sign-Language-Detection-Web-Application/

The final model created can be tested at the web application. The
'index.html' file can be opened on a browser locally and the web
application will work, however an internet connection is required
as even locally the web application needs to fetch the model from
GitHub
