=> IMPORTANT Note
1. All the selenium tests are commented out so please uncomment them to run them, they work successfully
2. The URL doesn't completely follow the format required (group21-group21.apps.kube.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), that's because the first project we created was having problems so we had to delete it and that name is no longer available. The URL provided above works.
